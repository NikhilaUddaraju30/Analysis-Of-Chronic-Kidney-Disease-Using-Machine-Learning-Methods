                        NALYSIS OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING METHOD

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) prediction is indeed a crucial issue in healthcare analytics, and machine learning can play an important role in improving the accuracy of prediction models.
Machine learning algorithms can analyse large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, allowing healthcare providers to make more informed decisions about patient diagnosis and
treatment. In the case of CKD, machine learning algorithms can be trained to identify patterns in patient data that are indicative of the disease. These patterns may include abnormalities in
urine or blood tests, as well as structural abnormalities in the kidneys. By analyzing these patterns, machine learning algorithms can predict the likelihood that a patient will develop
CKD, and can provide guidance to healthcare providers on how best to treat the disease.

In order to create accurate prediction models for CKD, healthcare providers must ensure that they are collecting high-quality patient data, and that they are using appropriate machine
learning techniques to analyse this data. In addition, healthcare providers must be careful to ensure that the use of machine learning in diagnosis and treatment does not replace the
expertise of healthcare professionals. While machine learning can provide valuable insights and guidance, it should always be used in conjunction with the knowledge and experience of
trained medical professionals.
